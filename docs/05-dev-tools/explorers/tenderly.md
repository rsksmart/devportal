Tenderly's [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer) for Rootstock allows you to monitor and inspect transactions, providing high level of details and additional tools.

Tenderly Developer Explorer lets you:
- Keep track specific [contracts](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer/contracts) and their transactions
- Inspect [transaction execution](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer/inspect-transaction) with fully decoded transaction trace
- [Debug](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger) failing and [simulate](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulator-ui/using-simulation-ui) correct transactions before sending them on-chain
- Evaluate [function-level gas usage](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/gas-profiler) for any transaction
- Set up [Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/tutorials-and-quickstarts/alerting-quickstart-guide) to monitor interactions, access control, asset transfers, and contracts' state changes
- Create a [Virtual TestNet](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets) from a specific OP Mainnet or OP Chain transaction for systematic research
