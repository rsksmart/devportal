Blockchain explorers are a special type of software that connect to a blockchain network, and display the data from an immutable public ledger.

Since it is open and transparent, there is nothing stopping multiple block explorers from displaying the data in a single blockchain. This is certainly true for Rootstock, and there are multiple block explorers. Think of it like a search engine but for the blockchains, it allows for exploring transactions, blocks, addresses, tokens, and even interacting with smart contracts.
