An attestation is a digital certificate or proof that verifies a specific claim or fact. It's like a digital stamp of approval, confirming something is true or has occurred.

## Real-world Examples

* Passport: A physical document attesting to a person's citizenship and right to travel internationally.
* University Degree: A certificate confirming academic achievement and qualifications.
* Driver's License: A legal document certifying the holder's ability to operate a motor vehicle.

## Web3 Attestations

In the web3 world, attestations are taking on a new dimension. They can be used to verify:

* Digital Identity: Proving one's identity without relying on centralized authorities.
* Asset Ownership: Confirming ownership of digital assets like NFTs or cryptocurrency.
* Credential Verification: Verifying skills, certifications, and work experience.

The Rootstock network is innovating in the attestation space, here are solutions that can be used for attesting documents or verifying identities within your dApps.
