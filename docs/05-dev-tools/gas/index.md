This is the unit used to measure the amount of computational work needed to perform tasks on the blockchain. When users make transactions or run smart contracts, they pay gas fees in the network's currency. These fees motivate miners and validators to process the transactions. Understanding gas is important for managing costs and ensuring that your transactions are executed efficiently. Read more about [rBTC Gas Fees: Optimizing Transaction Costs](https://dev.rootstock.io/concepts/rbtc/gas/) or [gas differences on Rootstock](/developers/blockchain-essentials/overview/#gas-differences).

To track and manage gas costs, you can use tools like the Rootstock Gas Station and Blocknative Gas Network API, which provide information on current gas prices.
