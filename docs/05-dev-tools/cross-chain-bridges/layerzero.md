Rootstock now integrates with LayerZero, a cross-chain messaging protocol. This integration enables the seamless movement of Bitcoin-backed assets from Rootstock to other blockchains, allowing developers to build omnichain applications (OApps) that interact across multiple chains as if they were one. Users can now move their Bitcoin across different DeFi ecosystems without complicated bridges, high fees, or slow transactions.
