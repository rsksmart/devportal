Super Bridge is a cross-chain bridge designed for the Rootstock ecosystem. It provides a seamless way for users to move assets between Rootstock and other blockchain networks.

- Peg-In (Move In): Transfer assets from other chains (like Bitcoin) into the Rootstock network.

- Peg-Out (Move Out): Transfer your assets from Rootstock back to their native or other supported chains.

## What the Bridge Does
The Super Bridge interface is built for maximum simplicity. You can explore all available exchange options, check rates, and view provider details before you even need to connect your wallet. This allows you to plan your transaction privately and securely.
