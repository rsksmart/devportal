Hyperlane is a permissionless interoperability protocol that facilitates easy communication and asset transfers between blockchain networks. 
It eliminates the need for centralized permissions, which enables developers to create and scale cross-chain applications effortlessly.

## Why Use Hyperlane?
Hyperlane makes cross-chain communication simple and accessible for developers. 

Why it stands out:
1. **No Permissions Needed:** Anyone can use Hyperlane on any blockchain—layer 1, rollup, or app-chain—without asking for approval.
2. **No Middlemen:** It removes the need for centralized services, giving developers full control over their applications.
3. **Easy Multi-Chain Setup:** Developers can quickly create apps that work across different blockchains.
4. **Customizable Security:** With Interchain Security Modules (ISMs), developers can adjust the security settings to fit their app's needs.
5. **Scalable and Flexible:** Hyperlane's design helps apps grow without bottlenecks or restrictions.


## Get Started with Hyperlane
Leverage pre-built components to kickstart your cross-chain development:

1. **Warp Routes:** Enable seamless movement of native and ERC20 tokens across chains.
2. **Interchain Accounts:** Allow accounts on one chain (e.g., a DAO) to execute smart contract calls on remote chains.
3. **Interchain Queries:** Facilitate view calls from one chain to retrieve data from remote chains.
