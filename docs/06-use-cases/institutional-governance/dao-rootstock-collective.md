RootstockCollective is the decentralized governing body for the Rootstock ecosystem. By participating, you influence treasury allocations, ecosystem grants, and protocol upgrades.

## Prerequisites
* **RIF Tokens:** The utility token used to gain governance power.
* **Staking Interface:** Access to the [RootstockCollective dApp](https://app.rootstockcollective.xyz/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Minting stRIF
Governance power is tied to `stRIF` (Staked RIF). You must stake your RIF 1:1 to receive voting rights.

1. **Connect Wallet:** Use your DAO-designated address.
2. **Stake RIF:** Approve the contract to spend your RIF, then execute the `stake` function.
3. **Receive stRIF:** You will receive `stRIF` tokens which represent your share of the governance pool.

### 2. Voting on Proposals
The DAO follows a **1 stRIF = 1 Vote** model.

* **Review Proposals:** Navigate to the "Governance" tab to see active funding or protocol requests.
* **Cast Vote:** Select "For", "Against", or "Abstain". You can also delegate your voting power to a "Shepherd" (governance expert) if you do not wish to vote manually.

### 3. Proposing Changes
Members with a significant `stRIF` balance (typically 1,000+) can submit formal proposals to the treasury for grant funding or infrastructure changes.

## Troubleshooting
* **Staking Rewards:** Rewards are distributed in rBTC and RIF. If your "Claimable Rewards" balance is zero, ensure you have actively "backed" a builder or project within the dApp.
* **Unstaking Period:** Check the current "Cooldown" period in the dApp; unstaking RIF usually involves a short delay to prevent governance attacks.
