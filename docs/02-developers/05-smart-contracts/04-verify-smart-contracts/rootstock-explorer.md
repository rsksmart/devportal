Contract verification is essential in the Rootstock ecosystem. It allows Rootstock Explorer users to inspect and validate the source code of deployed smart contracts.

The Rootstock Explorer provides a transparent view of the Rootstock blockchain, showing transactions, blocks, and deployed contracts. This transparency, enabled by verification, builds trust and understanding in decentralized applications.

## What does verification do?:
- Provides a `Verified` badge on the contract page, indicating that the source code corresponds to the deployed bytecode.
- Allows readable reading and writing of contract functions.
- Allows downloading the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI).

## Prerequisites

- Address of the deployed contract on Rootstock.
- Complete source code of the contract.
- Compiler details:
  - Solc (Solidity Compiler) version.
  - Number of optimization runs.
- Constructor parameters (if applicable).
- Library addresses (if used).


> In summary, this guide will help you verify your smart contract, allowing you to leverage these benefits and contribute to a more transparent and trustworthy decentralized environment on Rootstock.

## Visit the Rootstock Explorer

- To start the verification process go to the Rootstock Explorer [Testnet](https://explorer.testnet.rootstock.io/) or [Mainnet](https://explorer.rootstock.io/), find your contract using the search field.

- Once you reach your contract's address view, navigate to the "Contract" tab and click the "Verify Contract" button.

# Choosing Verification Method

Rootstock Explorer offers two main methods for contract verification:

- **Single File (Flattened)**: For simple contracts contained in a single file, where all imports have been "flattened" into a single file.
- **Multiple Files / Standard JSON** (Hardhat/Foundry/Truffle): For more complex projects with multiple files or those generated by development frameworks like Hardhat, Foundry.

| **Verification Method** | **When to Prefer** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Single File (Flattened)** | Small contracts, without complex imports or libraries. | Simple and fast for straightforward contracts. | Can be tedious to flatten large contracts or those with many dependencies. |
| **Multiple Files / Standard JSON** | Large projects, with dependencies, libraries, or generated by development frameworks. | Automatically handles imports and dependencies. | Requires exporting the Standard JSON file from your development environment. |


## Compiler Configuration

It is crucial that the compiler configuration in the explorer exactly matches that used during the compilation of your contract.

- **Select Solc version**: Choose the Solc version you used to compile your contract.

- **Optimization**:
  - If you used optimization run when compiling/deploying, enable it during verification and set the same runs (default 200).
  - If you didn’t use optimization, leave it disabled and don’t enter any runs.

- **EVM Version**: Choose the appropriate EVM version.

## Source Code Input

Provide your contract's source code.

- **Contract Name**:
  - Enter the exact name of the contract you deployed. This is required so the verifier can match the correct bytecode.

- **Paste/Upload source code**:
  - Single File: upload the .sol file.
  ![sol](/img/developers/smart-contracts/rsk-explorer/sol.png)
   - Standard JSON: Upload the standard-json file generated by your development framework.
  ![json](/img/developers/smart-contracts/rsk-explorer/json.png)

- **Constructor Arguments**:  You must enter constructor arguments separate by comma if you have more than one.
  ![args](/img/developers/smart-contracts/rsk-explorer/args.png)

- **Libraries**:
  - If your contract uses libraries, provide their names and deployed addresses.

## Submit and Validate
Once you have entered all the details, click "Verify Contract".

- **Expected statuses**: The verification status will change from "Pending" to "Success" or "Failure".
- **In case of success**:

  a. You will see the `Verified` badge on the contract page.

  b. Source code tabs will be visible.
  ![tabs](/img/developers/smart-contracts/rsk-explorer/tabs.png)

  c. You will be able to download the contract ABI.

  d. Contract read and write panels will be available.

  - **Write Methods**:

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems and their solutions:

- **Compiler version mismatch**:
  - Confirm the exact **Solc version** used to compile your contract.
  - Retrieve the version from your compilation artifacts.

- **Invalid constructor arguments**:
  - Verify the precise **encoding**, **order**, and **types** of your constructor arguments.

- **Library not found / address mismatch**:
  - Ensure **library names** match bytecode placeholders.
  - Add the correct **deployed addresses** for each library.

- **Optimization runs differ**:
  - Align the number of **optimization runs** with your compilation settings.

- **Flattening / import issues**:
  - Consider using the **Standard JSON** verification method to avoid path or flattening issues.

- **Proxy and Implementation**:
  - Verify the **implementation contract**.
  - Note any **proxy-aware UI** (if available) and how to link it.

> 💡 **Tip:** If verification keeps failing, try matching the compiler settings directly from your Hardhat or Foundry build artifacts.
