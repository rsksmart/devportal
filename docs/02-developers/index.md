Welcome to the Rootstock Developers Overview section. 

This section enables developers getting started with the Rootstock blockchain. Developers can install a local development environment using Hardhat, etc, create and test contracts with the libraries provided and use the libraries to build decentralized applications 

:::info[Info]
* Looking to quickly test your dApp on testnet before deploying to mainnet? Use the [Rootstock RPC API](https://rpc.rootstock.io/) or view the [json-rpc methods](/developers/rpc-api/rootstock/methods/) available on the RPC API.
* Dive right in with [step-by-step guides](/developers/quickstart/) to get your development environment set up and deploy your first dApp.
