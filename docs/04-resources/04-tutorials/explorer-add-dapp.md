## 8. Viewing Token Information in the Explorer.

If your dApp is a token-based project, the Explorer will automatically index and display token information based on the submitted contract address.
Once the token contract is deployed and included in the dApp submission:
- Users can search for the token by name or by contract address using the Explorer search bar.
- The token will appear as a search result under the Token section.
- Selecting the token opens the token details view, where the following information is displayed:
  - Token name and symbol.
  - Token contract address.
  - Token standard (e.g. ERC-20).
  - Token logo.
  - Project website.
