### Disclosure Policy

- Follow Immunefi's [disclosure guidelines](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/).
- Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. If the user reports the vulnerability to other security teams (e.g. Ethereum or ETC, Ledger) but reports to RootstockLabs with considerable delay, then RootstockLabs may reduce or cancel the bounty.

### Scope and Rules

Visit the [Scope Section on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/rootstocklabs/scope/#top) to view the scope / out of scope vulnerability, and the program rules.
