These are the minimum requirements that must be met to run an Rootstock node (Mainnet and Testnet):

* 4 cores
* 8 GB RAM
* 128 GB storage
* OS x64

:::info[Parallel Transaction Execution]
Rootstock nodes require a minimum of 4 CPU cores to support parallel transaction execution ([RSKIP-144](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP144.md)), which improves transaction throughput and scalability.

> RSKj allows you to run a Rootstock node, crucial for local development and testing. It supports connections to Regtest (local), Testnet (testing), and Mainnet (production). Visit the [official RSKj GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj) to download the latest stable release.
