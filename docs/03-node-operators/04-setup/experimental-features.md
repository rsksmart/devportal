Below you can find all the experimental features released with RSKj, alongside the version and
height in which they were introduced, there are instructions on how you can configure, customize
and start using them.

## Snapshot Sync

**TL;DR** Snapshot Sync is an experimental feature that allows RSKj nodes to synchronize using a
snapshot of the state of the blockchain, rather than downloading the whole blocks starting from
genesis. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to synchronize a node, especially for large
blockchains.

Full Long Sync is the standard method for getting a new RSKj node to match up with the existing
blockchain network. The goal is to make sure the new node downloads and checks every transaction,
contract, and block, starting from the very first one. This approach uses up quite a bit of time and
computer resources.

Snapshot Sync is designed to make the sync process faster but still safe: Instead of getting the
whole blockchain history, state data is downloaded up to a certain point where there's enough
information to rebuild the whole state quickly.

Snapshot Sync main goal is to have a new RSKj node ready to use in a shorter time in comparison to
using the default Full Long Sync method.

### How to Configure Snap-Capable Nodes
Nodes can be configured as Snap servers and/or clients by adding a new `snapshot` config block to the `sync` configurations.

#### Snap Server
A node can be configured as a Snap Server by simply adding the following to the `sync` configuration block:

```yaml
snapshot = {
	server = {
		enabled = <bool>
	}
}
```

#### Snap Client

Snap client configurations must also be added to the `sync` configuration block, they allows for many options to be tweaked:

```yaml
snapshot = {
	client = {
		enabled = <bool>
		checkHistoricalHeaders = <bool>
		parallel = <bool>
		chunkSize = <chunkSize>
		limit = <limit>
		snapBootNodes = [
			{
				nodeId = <id>
				ip = <ip>
				port = <port>
			}
		]
	}
}
```

#### ⚠️ Important Notes
- The minimal `sync` configuration for Snap Sync **MUST** include the `enabled` property set to `true` beside the node being configured as a Snap-Capable server or client, like this:

```yaml
sync {
	enabled = true
	<SNAP_SYNC_CONF>
}
```

- There's an extra option added to peer configuration section that can be used to further tweak the Snap Sync process:

```yaml
peer {
	...
	messageQueue {
		...
		# Reject peer's messages over this threshold
    # It's calculated using exponential moving average
		thresholdPerMinutePerPeer = <int>
	}
}
```

### Snap-Related RSKCli Tool Options

The `RskCli` tool accepts two options regarding Snap Sync:

`--sync-mode` can be used to set the synchronization mode. It accepts one string containing `full` or `snap` as values.

`--snap-nodes` can be used to set a list of Snap-Capable peers to connect to. It accepts a string list of nodes in the format `enode://PUBKEY@HOST:PORT`

### Monitoring

In order to know if the process is working, *snapshotprocessor* logs may be filtered out by executing `tail -f /path/to/rsk/logs/rsk.log | grep “snapshotprocessor”`, log messages will be different depending on the node being a Snap server or client.

#### Snap Server Logs

The first *snapshotprocessor* related log line will appear once a client start asking for Snap messages, and looks like this:

```
2025-04-01-01:22:00.195 DEBUG [snapshotprocessor]  Processing snapshot status request, checkpointBlockNumber: 220000, bestBlockNumber: 221583
```

And then, messages like these are going to be repeated until there's no more clients asking for messages:

```

2025-04-01-01:27:39.867 DEBUG [snapshotprocessor]  Processing state chunk request from node...
```

#### Snap Client Logs

In the Snap client side, the first *Snapshotprocessor* related line will look like this:

```
2025-04-01-01:22:00.179 INFO [snapshotprocessor]  Starting Snap sync
```

Followed by a stream of messages similar to these:

```

...
```

Until the whole process ends, and the following logs will look something like these:

```

2025-04-01-01:27:41.879 INFO [snapshotprocessor]  State final validation OK!
