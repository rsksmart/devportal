_From your repository:_

1. A GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on an Approval event.
2. The workflow:
- Generates a GitHub App installation token.
- Clones the rsksmart/devportal repository using that token.
- Transforms your local file(s) into the format/layout expected by the DevPortal.
-- Commits and pushes a branch to rsksmart/devportal.
-- Creates a Pull Request in rsksmart/devportal.
3. Once the PR is merged, the DevPortal `/changelog` page reflects the new content.

Everything is done through the GitHub App.
